#PYTHON CONTROL FLOWS:
#Conditional statements-CS helps in decision making process i.e “Are you hungry? If so, then eat”
    #"Are you hungry" is a boolean expressions here so the conditional statement is checking if it's True.
    #If "are you hungry" ==True then the conditional statement will be executed and you will eat.
    #If (you are hungry) the (eat food)
#Another example: You girlfriend can tell you that "You either stop this habit or I'll leave you"

#In Python we have 3 Conditional Statements.
 #a) If Statements
 #b) If .. else statement
 #c) If ..elif statement
