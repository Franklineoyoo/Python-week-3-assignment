#Functions:

#Is a modular piece of code that can be used repeatedly.
#Is a block of code executed when it called in a program.
#This code comes to live when you call it.
#Python functions are perfect for abstraction. They allow us to write blocks of code which can be reused in different ways and in different programs.
#How to Create a Function:
#Python function is defined using the “def” keyword.
#DEF keyword is used to define the function in python.
#Steps:
#a) We use the "def" keyword to define a function i.e def func_name():
#b) We write the function name  that can be anything the inside we write a block of code.
#c) We call that function.

def func_name():
    print("My name is Frankline Oyoo")
 #we need to call the function:
func_name()


#Passing of Arguments and Paremeters in Python

#Arguments - Indormation that can be passed into functions as an arguments.
#They are specified after functions name.

def my_func():
    print(fName + "It's awesome to be here")
my_func("Frankline")
